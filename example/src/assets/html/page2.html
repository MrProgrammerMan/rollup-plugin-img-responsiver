  <h1>This is page 2</h1>
  <p>It also has images, and they too, are responive(this is very cool)</p>
  <p>This works because the location of the images as well as this html file have been specified to the img-responsiver plugin.</p>
  <p>The plugin only modifies images and html in the specified directories.</p>
  <p>This example project has a full config definition in vite.config.ts</p>
  <p>You can omit any of the fields, and the default will apply instead.</p>
  <br>
  <img src="../imgs/cat-with-open-mouth.webp" alt="A cat with it's mouth open.">
  <p>Below is an image that recides in a folder that isn't specified to the plugin.</p>
  <p>It is not responsive, but loads in it's original size and format.</p>
  <img src="../imgs-not-responsive/a-png-cat.png" alt="A cat with transparent background in png format.">
  <p>The plugin also works for images with the same name in different directories.</p>
  <p>Enjoy :)</p>
